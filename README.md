Creating a REST API with Node.js and Oracle Database

The goal will be to create an API that supports basic CRUD functionality on the EMPLOYEES table in the HR sample schema. By the end of this series, you should be able to make an informed decision about what’s best for your own projects.

This post will provide the links to all the posts in the series, details on the target environment, and an overview of the high-level components that I’ll use in the project. The sample code for each post will be made available in the javascript/rest-api directory of the oracle-db-examples repo on GitHub.
